                    <p>WACO, Texas -- Udoka Azubuike and No. 3 Kansas returned the favor in a Big 12 showdown that lived up to the hype.The Jayhawks share the Big 12 lead again, and could return to the No. 1 spot in the AP poll, as well. Azubuike had 23 points and a career-high 19 rebounds in a 64-61 win Saturday at Baylor, ending the Bears' 23-game winning streak and likely ending the Bears' five-week run as the nation's No. 1 team."You could just feel the buzz. It was an exciting time and a huge win," Jayhawks guard Devon Dotson said. "We're a solid team that can make a run in late, late March. ... We're going to enjoy this win, but build off it for sure."</p>

                    <p>When it comes time to race, many swimmers, especially those racing in high-level competitions, wear specialized knee-length swimsuits known as tech suits. They’re everywhere in the swimming world.According to a study done by <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.525.2196&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Journal Of The American College Of Sports Medicine</a>, the suits significantly improve swimming performance. The study found that, on average, swim performance improved by 3.2% when swimmers wore a tech suit as opposed to a regular training suit. Additionally, the study found that tech suits can reduce drag by 4.4% to 6.2% and reduce the amount of energy needed for swimming by 4.5% to 5.5%</p>
